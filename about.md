Hello, Welcome to my website!

Here's Hannah, a sophomore year computer science student at University of Victoria, BC, Canada, come from East Asian.

I just start learning how to build a personal website, so you might find lots of weird context and webpage here, that is because I haven't change the theme defaults yet.

This website is mainly about projects and notes of school/online courses.
